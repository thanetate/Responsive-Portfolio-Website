                I designed and developed a fully functional e-commerce website for a climbing clothing brand "Theory Climbing" from scratch. Using new technologies like Next.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, and Paypal's API. I have been a devoted climber for 6 years now and my friends and I have always wanted to create a climbing related clothing brand. Using my knowledge from University, I thought it would be a great idea to try and build a website myself. The website features a dynamic product catalog, secure user authentication, shopping cart functionality, and a seamless checkout process. The project demonstrates my ability to build scalable and responsive web applications, with a focus on performance, user experience, and modern development practices.
